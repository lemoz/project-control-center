title: Canvas Visualization Evaluation
goal: Compare the five visualization approaches and recommend which to develop further toward Canvas City.
context:
  - WO-2026-091 through WO-2026-096 (visualization explorations)
  - WO-2026-066 (Canvas City concept - end goal)
  - Need to decide which approach(es) to invest in
acceptance_criteria:
  - Use each visualization for real work for at least 1 day
  - Document pros/cons of each approach
  - Note which questions from each WO were answered
  - Identify which concepts worked and which didn't
  - Recommend: single winner, hybrid approach, or pivot
  - Identify what's needed to evolve winner toward Canvas City
non_goals:
  - Formal user testing (just personal evaluation)
  - Quantitative metrics (qualitative is fine)
  - Final decision (recommendation for discussion)
stop_conditions:
  - If all approaches feel wrong, document why and brainstorm alternatives
priority: 3

## Evaluation Framework

### For Each Visualization

| Question | Rating (1-5) | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| Can I assess system health quickly? | | |
| Does it surface what needs attention? | | |
| Is it visually engaging? | | |
| Does it scale to many items? | | |
| Is the interaction intuitive? | | |
| Does it match mental model? | | |
| Would I use this daily? | | |

### Specific Hypotheses to Validate

**A: Activity Pulse**
- [ ] Does "life" feel engaging?
- [ ] Do pulses draw attention appropriately?

**B: Force-Directed Graph**
- [ ] Do meaningful clusters emerge?
- [ ] Are dependency chains visible?

**C: Timeline River**
- [ ] Does flow feel natural?
- [ ] Can you spot bottlenecks?

**D: Heatmap Grid**
- [ ] Health assessment in <2 seconds?
- [ ] Do problems jump out?

**E: Orbital/Gravity**
- [ ] Intuitive attention metaphor?
- [ ] Satisfying to watch work move?

## Comparison Matrix

| Aspect | A:Pulse | B:Graph | C:River | D:Heat | E:Orbital |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|--------|-----------|
| Health at glance | | | | | |
| Relationships | | | | | |
| Progress/flow | | | | | |
| Scalability | | | | | |
| Engagement | | | | | |
| Simplicity | | | | | |
| Path to Canvas City | | | | | |

## Output

### What Worked
- ...

### What Didn't Work
- ...

### Recommendation
- Primary approach: ...
- Elements to borrow from others: ...
- Next steps toward Canvas City: ...

### Hybrid Possibilities
- Could combine X from A with Y from B?
- Zoom levels: Overview = D, Detail = A?
- etc.
